                    Hello Everyone,

                    Welcome to Frame-ha-me-ha! This was a personal project that I have been working on to try and bring together multpile assets and resources. Recently <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Jonathan.Thats_Plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">That's Plus</a>(If you havent checked it out, you should.), was released by <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathan_tene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">Jonathan Tene</a> which was a huge motivator to finish this project. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Hopefully this can help fill a gap for any non android users out there. Or if you are looking to get this information on a PC/Mac without digging into the excel sheets. Speaking of those sheets this entire thing is not possible without <a href="https://twitter.com/RinSenpaiii" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">@Rin-senpaii</a> and <a href ="https://twitter.com/rafestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">@Turtleon</a> putting in an amazing amount of work on the doc's that enabled this kind of resource. I would also like to thank whoever is managing the hitbox viewer but I cannot seem to find their information, if you have it let me know. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Thank you everyone who has contributed to the DBFZ community to make this resource a possibility, special shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/rathfgc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">RathFGC</a> (Gotta rep our AZ fam) and ALL DBFZ content creators, for creating awesome videos that can help new and old comers alike. And remember to tech those dragon rushes.
