                        Neutral involves a couple different ideas clumped together that create a mindgame and interactions between you and your opponent. Generally speaking, when neither player is in an advantagous state but you are making decisions and movement to gain it, you are playing "footsies". 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The idea behind footsies is while not putting yourself at risk, getting your opponent to make a move that puts them in a punishable state. This can be whiffing buttons to force a reaction, running up and blocking, or jumping around. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If the opponent moves, or attacks and whiffs the move, you may be able to counter attack and begin doing damage. Another common idea is Advantage/Disadvantage. Advantage and Disadvantage are directly inverse. If you have your opponent blocking, or you are pummeling their face in, you are in the Advantage state and the opponent is at a Disadvantage. 
                        </p>

                        To try and better understand the idea behind neutral, lets look at a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4n3mpDrD-noB7uMkKSD00Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">RathFGC (His Youtube)</a>.

                        Superdash has a bad reputation out in the Netplay streets as being an "EZ Neutral" button. It does have some strength to it and creates a new problem to think about during neutral, however I would not say it is an end all button. Paired with an assist Superdash becomes a very powerful tool that can feel overwhelming.

                        Combos are great, they feel good and help you on your quest for world domination(defending the universe). However, you first have to hit your opponent before you can move into doing your awesome combos. How do we get a hit? Is there some sort of trick? A gambit? An aggreement? No. You must mix-up your opponent. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        According to dotesports, a mix-up is defined as "A mix up refers to a combination that uses a number of different attacks (high, low, overhead, throw,) which a require specific defenses to guard against. Certain mix ups can be exceptionally difficult to block, which makes them one of the foundational strategies in fighting games".

                        Knowing when, or even how you are on either side of the Advantageous/Disadvantageous coin is important when trying to participate in the neutral mind game. All fighting games function using the follow. Every move requies a certain amount of frames before it hits, how long it hits, and how long it takes before you can do another action.

                        Every move also has hit, and hurt boxes to show where your move actually can make contact with the opponent and where you can be hit.  In Dragonball Fighterz, and on Framehameha, you will see Green boxes representing your own hurt box, and red boxes for where your move can hit the opponent.
